# Search: Comparing traditional technology with Vector Embeddings
*Search products such as Elastic Search and Azure AI Search provide Hybrid Search capabilities. This approach combines data from both traditional search methods and new similarity search algorithms using Vector Embeddings. In this repo we will understand both technologies by implementing from ground up.*

1. Purpose of "**Vector_Embedding/text_embedding_analysis.ipynb**" notebook is to analyze output from Open AI Text Embedding model and compare outputs for different word / sentence instances. Open AI Text Embedding models output vectors of size 1536 representing word / sentence context.![
