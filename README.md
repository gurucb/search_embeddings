# Search: Comparing traditional technology with Vector Embeddings
Search products such as Elastic Search and Azure AI Search provide Hybrid Search capabilities. This approach combines data from both traditional search methods and new similarity search algorithms using Vector Embeddings. In this repo we will understand both technologies by implementing from ground up.
